## Installation

**Note: These dotfiles are designed for `NixOS`, no guarantees about functionality, safety, or reliability are made for installation on any other operating system.**

To install these dotfiles to your system, run the `install.sh` script. This tiny script just moves the config directories under `~/.config/`, rebuilds NixOS, and optionally sets up a git repository.
